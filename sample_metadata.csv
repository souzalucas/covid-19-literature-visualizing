Recent immunological research has focused on innate immunity as the first line of host defense, especially pattern recognition molecules such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs), RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs), and NOD-like receptors (NLRs). Various microbial components are recognized by their vague and common molecular shapes so-called, pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). PAMPs induce inflammatory reactions mediated by the activation of the transcription factor, NF-κB, and by interferons, which lead to an antiviral immune response. Viruses have the capacity to suppress or escape from this pattern recognition molecule-mediated antimicrobial response in various ways. In this paper, we review the various strategies used by viruses to modulate the pattern recognition molecule-mediated innate immune response.",2010-06-16,"Yokota, Shin-ichi; Okabayashi, Tamaki; Fujii, Nobuhiro",Mediators Inflamm,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/b29aec7c51b6c428e566fa6e092797fc4da21b29.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2903949.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2903949/,

Since the identity of emerging pathogens from animal reservoirs is difficult to predict, the development for pathogen-specific therapeutics and vaccines is problematic. The highly pathogenic SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) emerged from zoonotic pools in 2002 to cause a global epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Many patients with SARS-CoV experienced an exacerbated form of disease called acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) requiring mechanical ventilation and supplemental oxygen and half of these patients died. Similar to other viral pathogens like influenza and West Nile Virus, the severity of SARS-CoV disease increased with age. Unfortunately, successful vaccination in the most vulnerable populations is a difficult task because of immunological deficiencies associated with aging (immune senescence). Due to the rapidity of virus emergence, technologies like synthetic biology can be harnessed to facilitate rapid recombinant virus construction for studying the novel virus biology, pathogenesis and the evaluation of therapeutic interventions. Since predicting the antigenic identity of future emergence is difficult, candidate vaccines and therapeutics should have a maximal breadth of cross-protection, and panels of antigenically divergent synthetically reconstructed viruses can be used as tools for this evaluation. We discuss how synthetic reconstruction of many animal and human SARS-CoV has provided a model to study the molecular mechanisms governing emergence and pathogenesis of viral diseases.

However, nowadays serverless computing offers a new way of developing and deploying cloud-native applications. Serverless computing also called NoOps, offloads management and server configuration (operations work) from the user to the cloud provider and lets the user focus only on the product developments. Hence, there are debates regarding which deployment strategy to use. This research provides a performance comparison of a cloud-native web application along with three different function benchmarks in terms of scalability, reliability, and latency when deployed using DevOps and NoOps deployment strategy. NoOps deployment in this work is achieved using Google Cloud Function and OpenWhisk, while DevOps is achieved using the Kubernetes engine. This research shows that neither of the deployment strategies fits all the scenarios. The experimental results demonstrate that each type of deployment strategy has its advantages under different scenarios. The DevOps deployment strategy has a huge performance advantage (almost 72% lesser 90 percentile response time) for simple web-based requests and requests accessing databases while compute-intensive applications perform better with NoOps deployment.

In over 30 years since, there have been dramatic advances in satellite, networking and ground system technologies, solutions, and services, the scope of which go well beyond what can be addressed in this Handbook. The modest objective of this chapter is to provide key insights into the evolution of satellite networks and associated ground systems that today serve all global market sectors. It identifies applications for which the transformative potential of electronically steerable phased arrays (described in chapter 10.1007/978-3-030-36308-6_30) is poised to displace mechanically steered parabolic antennas as large-scale, small satellite constellations are launched. The net result will be an expansion of global satellite markets and diversification of ground systems, as VSATs and flat panel, phased array solutions supplement each other to fuel the expansion. The world of small satellite constellations in LEO and MEO orbits will extend the reach of satellite communications, particularly in underserved portions of the world. By eliminating mechanical steering, flat panel antennas with electronic tracking will open up new addressable mobility markets through lower cost and compact packaging, whether for airborne, maritime, train, or land vehicle applications.

METHODS Opioid-naïve patients undergoing primary cardiac surgery via median sternotomy between January-December 2019 at 10 hospitals participating in a statewide collaborative were selected. Clinical data were linked to patient-reported outcomes collected at 30-day follow-up. An opioid prescribing recommendation stratified by inpatient opioid use on the day before discharge (0, 1-3, or ≥4 pills) was implemented in July 2019. Interrupted time-series analyses were performed for prescription size and post-discharge opioid use before (January-June) and after (July-December) guideline implementation. RESULTS Among 1495 patients (729 pre- and 766 post-recommendation), median prescription size decreased from 20 to 12 pills after recommendation release (p<0.001), while opioid use decreased from 3 to 0 pills (p<0.001). Change in prescription size over time was +0.6 pills/month before and -0.8 pills/month after the recommendation (difference: -1.4 pills/month, p=0.036). Change in patient use was +0.6 pills/month before and -0.4 pills/month after the recommendation (difference: -1.0 pills/month, p=0.017).

METHODS In thisretrospective, multicenter study, the medical records of elderly patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19 in Hunan province, China, from January 21 to February 19, 2020 were reviewed. The characteristics of young-old patients and old-old patients were compared. RESULTS Of the 105 elderly patientsconfirmed withCOVID-19, 81.0% were young-old patients, and 19.0% were old-old patients; 54.3% of elderly patients were females. Overall, 69.5% of elderly patients had underlying diseases, and the most common comorbidities included hypertension (43.8%), diabetes (25.7%), and cardiac disease (16.2%). Of the elderly patients, 22.9% were severe and 10.5% were critical severe cases. On admission, the most frequent symptoms in elderly patients included fever (66.7%), cough (64.8%), and fatigue (33.3%). Lymphopenia (31.4%), increased D-dimer (38.1%), depressed albumin (36.2%), elevated lactate dehydrogenase (41.0%), and a high level of C-reactive protein (79.0%) were common among elderly patients with COVID-19. The median prothrombin time (PT) and the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) were longer in old-old patients than young-old patients (PT median 12.3 vs. 13.1 s, p = 0.007; APTT median 39.0 vs. 33.5 s, p = 0.045). Young-old patients showed fewer complications (14.1%) than old-old patients (40.0%; p = 0.0014) and fewer received invasive ventilator support (3.5 vs. 25.0%, p = 0.006). As of March 11, 2020, 85.7% of elderly patients had been discharged, 3 deaths had occurred, and 11.4% were still hospitalized. CONCLUSIONS Elderly patients usually have chronic medical illness and are likely to have a severe or critically severe condition.

The ideal devices used for this purpose should have features such as low incidence of complications, high survival rate, rapid control of the airway, and adequate ventilation. Besides limiting the frequency and duration of interruptions in chest compressions, they can improve the survival and clinical outcomes of return of spontaneous circulation during cardiopulmonary resuscitation. The overall rates of survival from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest have improved dramatically in recent years. However, optimal airway management during out-of-hospital cardiac arrest is a controversial issue. The proposed standard of care, i.e. endotracheal intubation, may have paradoxical adverse effects on intended outcomes by interrupting cardiopulmonary resuscitation and by reduction of coronary and cerebral perfusion pressure during resuscitation.

Previously, we developed a liver-regeneration therapy using autologous bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs), which is under clinical investigation. Cell-cell interactions between BMSCs and macrophages (Mφs) participate in the improvement of liver function and alleviation of liver fibrosis, although the associated mechanisms have not been elucidated. Therefore, in this study, we investigated phenotypic changes in Mφs caused by interactions with BMSCs, as well as the underlying mechanisms. Co-culturing lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated murine bone marrow-derived Mφs (BMDMs) with BMSCs substantially upregulated matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9), MMP12, and MMP13 expression, and downregulated tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα) expression. To identify humoral factors involved in phenotypic changes occurring in Mφs, microarray analysis was performed with microRNAs (miRNAs) derived from extracellular vesicles in the supernatant of co-cultured BMSCs and LPS-stimulated BMDMs. We found that miR-6769b-5p was highly expressed and that transfecting miR-6769b-5p mimic upregulated MMP9 in LPS-stimulated BMDMs and downregulated TNFα and interleukin-1beta (IL-1β). MiR-6769b-5p expression in BMDMs was decreased by LPS stimulation but was increased by co-culture with BMSCs. Microarray and pathway analyses of gene expression in LPS-stimulated, miR-6769b-5p-transfected BMDMs revealed changes in the eukaryotic initiation factor 2-signaling pathway and decreased the expression of activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4). LPS-stimulated BMDMs exhibited increased MMP9 expression and decreased the expression of TNFα and IL-1β by ATF4 knockdown. These findings indicate that upregulating miR-6769b-5p in BMDMs induced a fibrolytic phenotype, where MMP9 was highly expressed and inflammatory cytokine expression was decreased by the suppression of ATF4 expression. These findings imply that regulating miR-6769b-5p or ATF4 expression in BMDMs may be helpful for treating chronic liver disease.",2020-09-22,"Nishi, Maiko; Matsumoto, Toshihiko; Fujisawa, Koichi; Suehiro, Yutaka; Takami, Taro; Yamamoto, Naoki; Yamasaki, Takahiro; Sakaida, Isao",Stem cells and development,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1089/scd.2020.0123; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32962510/,221864889

These effects of pneumoperitoneum are associated with significant haemodynamic changes, increasing the morbidity of the patient. AIM The present study compared the efficacy of dexmedetomidine and esmolol on hemodynamic responses during laparoscopic cholecystectomy Materials and Methods: A total of 90 patients aged 20-60 y, American Society of Anaesthesiologists (ASA) physical status I or II, of either sex, planned for laparoscopic cholecystectomy were included. The patients were randomly divided into three groups of 30 each. Group D received dexmedetomidine loading dose 1 mcg/kg over a period of 15 min and maintenance 0.5 mcg/kg/h throughout the pneumoperitoneum. Group E received esmolol loading dose 1 mg/kg over a period of 5 min and maintenance 0.5 mg/kg/h throughout the pneumoperitoneum. Group C received same volume of normal saline. MEASUREMENTS Heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure and mean arterial pressure (MAP) were recorded preoperative, after study drug, after induction, after intubation, after pneumoperitoneum at 15 min intervals, post pneumoperitoneum and postoperative period after 15 min. Propofol induction dose, intraoperative fentanyl requirement and sedation score were also recorded. RESULTS In group D, there was no statistically significant increase in HR and blood pressure after pneumoperitoneum at any time intervals, whereas in Group E, there was a statistical significant increase in MAP after pneumoperitoneum at 15, 45, and 60 min only and HR during the whole pneumoperitoneum period. There was a significant decrease in induction dose of propofol and intraoperative fentanyl requirement in Group D and E, compared to Group C (p<0.0001).

Clinical trials have provided a limited understanding of the contributions of multiple triggers and processes of intensive care unit (ICU) acquired delirium, making identification of therapies difficult. Delirium is independently associated with poor long term outcomes, including persistent cognitive impairment. A longer duration of delirium is associated with worse long term cognition after adjustment for age, education, pre-existing cognitive function, severity of illness, and exposure to sedatives.

METHODS Retrospective longitudinal study on matched data from March 1, 2019 to December 31, 2019. The data are extracted from the French prospective payment system. We studied 12 of the most commonly performed in ERAS business segments. The primary outcome was the reduction of the average length of hospital stay and its implications on production costs and excess capacity. We also studied the impact on hospital incomes and Social Security Insurance Program expenses. The potential gain in hospital days was computed by comparing the length of stay of ERAS and non-ERAS cases. The cost reduction was estimated using the mean number of avoidable days of hospitalization, and the mean cost of the stays obtained from the national cost study. Finally, we studied an approximation of the additional expense for the Social Security Health Insurance Program on costs standardized by applying public sector rates. RESULTS The average length of stay reduction attributed to ERAS is 1.45 (CI 95% 1.42 to 1.48) day per stay, translating to a cost reduction for the hospitals of € 1060 (CI 95% 995 to 1125) per patient and a total of €65 million (CI 95% 61 to 69). At the same time, the additional expenses for the Social Security Insurance Program can conservatively be approximated to € 1.6 million, breaking into a € 2.2 million increase partially compensated by cost savings of € 0.6 million over subsequent stays for complications. Overall, for each percent of additional ERAS activity over the scope of the study, the marginal cost reduction for the hospitals can be estimated to € 1.8 million (CI 95% 1.7 million to 2.0 million).

Protein modules reflect groups of tightly co-ordinated changes in protein abundance across healthy and OA chondrocytes. RESULTS The unbiased systems analysis identified extracellular matrix (ECM) mechanosensing and glycolysis as two modules that are most highly correlated with ΟΑ. The ECM module was enriched in the OA genetic risk factors tenascin-C (TNC) and collagen 11A1 (COL11A1), as well as in cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP), a biomarker associated with cartilage integrity. Mapping proteins that are unique to OA or healthy chondrocytes onto the core interactome, which connects microenvironment sensing and regulation of glycolysis, identified differences in metabolic and anti-inflammatory adaptation.

Opioids are used to block stimulus of cranial pinning in neurosurgery. We investigated the effect of different infusion rates of sufentanil on SSI during cranial pinning in children under general anaesthesia. METHODS Forty-nine children (2-12 years of age) underwent neurosurgery with pinning. The children were randomized into three groups based on the rate of sufentanil infusion: 0.2, 0.5, and 0.8 μg·kg-1·hr.-1. Continuous sufentanil infusion began following neuromuscular blockade administration, at a rate determined by each patient's assigned treatment group. Following preparation for surgery, cranial pinning was performed. Systolic, diastolic, and mean blood pressures, along with heart rate and photoplethysmographic data, were continuously recorded from 1 min prior to cranial pinning through 5 min after cranial pinning, in 1-min intervals. SSI was calculated following the completion of surgery. Differences in measured outcomes over time among the three groups were evaluated using a generalized estimation equation. Differences in pinning outcomes in the same group were evaluated with Freidman test. RESULTS We found no statistical differences in long-term SSI that were associated with different infusion rates of sufentanil during cranial pinning. Blood pressures in all groups increased for 2 min after cranial pinning, and then decreased; we found no statistical difference in long-term blood pressure values among the groups. Heart rate increased after pinning in the group that received a low-dose infusion of sufentanil. CONCLUSIONS Since SSI was intended to measure the blunting effects of sufentanil towards the noxious stimulus of cranial pinning, our results suggest that SSI might not be sufficiently sensitive to monitor the nociceptive response in children.

A qualitative study was implemented using a phenomenological approach to answer the research question: How do adults with developmental disabilities (DD) currently use digital media and the digital world? This question was posed to create a baseline for this population's already established uses of and difficulties with digital spaces and digital technology. Eleven participants engaged, observed, and were interviewed while partaking in free programing (Sept. 2019 to April 2020) at a university. This programming matched adults with DD with undergraduate students that focused on learning and creating digital art. Unfortunately, the programing was halted a month early due to the COVID-19 Pandemic. The data collected was analyzed through thematic analysis that uncovered six emergent themes: effects of digital literacy deficits, online social interactions, positive and novel experiences, knowledge equals autonomy, digital visitor, and caregiver's role. A fortuitous result was observed in that participants appeared to increase their self-confidence and social interactions with others throughout their time in the program and increased their time engaging with digital art. The results demonstrate how the lack of digital inclusion contributes to unnecessary barriers for adults with DD in accessing online art therapy and digital art therapy without support.

The impact of this on young people’s mental health and future prospects may affect their need for support and services, and the speed of the nation’s social recovery afterwards. This study focused on the unique challenges facing young people at different points during adolescent development, which spans from the onset of puberty until the mid-twenties. Although this is an immensely challenging time and there is a potential risk for long term trauma, adolescence can be a period of opportunity, where the teenagers’ brain enjoys greater capacity for change. Hence, the focus on young people is key for designing age-specific interventions and public policies, which can offer new strategies for instilling resilience, emotional regulation, and self-control. In fact, adolescents might be assisted to not only cope, but excel, in spite of the challenges imposed by this pandemic. Our work will feed into the larger societal response that utilizes the discoveries about adolescence in the way we raise, teach, and treat young people during this time of crisis.

Prolonged replication in immunosuppressed individuals and evasion from spike-specific antibodies is known to drive intra-host SARS-CoV-2 evolution. Here we show for the first time the major role of CD8 T cells in SARS-CoV-2 evolution. In a patient with chronic, ultimately fatal infection, we observed three spike mutations that prevented neutralisation by convalescent plasma therapy. Moreover, at least four mutations in non-spike proteins emerged that hampered CD8 T-cell recognition of mutant epitopes, two of these occurred before spike mutations. A comparison with worldwide sequencing data showed that several of these T-cell escape mutations had emerged independently as homoplasies in multiple circulating lineages.

In this context, it is very important to identify super-spreaders that maximize or minimize propagation. Lately, studies for detecting super-spreaders have gained momentum. Most of the studies carried out aim to distinguish the influences of nodes under a specific propagation model (such as SIR) using network centrality measures and subsequently, to rank the nodes accordingly. However, in this study, we developed an algorithm that approximates the expected influence of nodes under the popular SIR model. By considering the behavior of the SIR model and only the shortest paths between nodes, the algorithm ranks the nodes according to this approximated value. Our developed algorithm is named the Expected Value Estimation (EVE).

8v7150vv,,WHO,RIG-I-induced innate antiviral immunity protects mice from lethal SARS-CoV-2 infection,,,,unk,"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has underscored the need for rapidly employable prophylactic and antiviral treatments against emerging viruses. Nucleic acid agonists of the innate immune system can be administered to activate an effective antiviral program for prophylaxis in exposed populations, a measure of particular relevance for SARS-CoV-2 infection due to its efficient evasion of the host antiviral response. In this study, we utilized the K18-hACE2 mouse model of COVID-19 to examine whether prophylactic activation of the antiviral receptor RIG-I protects mice from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Systemic treatment of mice with a specific RIG-I ligand one to seven days prior to infection with a lethal dose of SARS-CoV-2 improved their survival of by up to 50 %. Improved survival was associated with lower viral load in oropharyngeal swabs and in the lungs and brain of RIG-I-treated mice. Moreover, despite antiviral protection, the surviving mice that were treated with RIG-I ligand developed adaptive SARS-CoV-2-specific immunity. These results reveal that prophylactic RIG-I activation by synthetic RNA oligonucleotides is a promising strategy to convey short-term, unspecific antiviral protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection and may be a suitable broad-spectrum approach to constraining the spread of newly emerging viruses until virus-specific therapies and vaccines become available.",2021,"Marx, Samira; Kuemmerer, Beate M; Gruetzner, Christian; Kato, Hiroki; Schlee, Martin; Bartok, Eva; Renn, Marcel; Hartmann, Gunther",,,#ppbiorxiv-455405,,,,,236961823

The survey involved a questionnaire and a PCR test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We surveyed HCWs in COVID-19 units and comparison units (internal medicine and cardiology) between 30th April and 7th May 2020. RESULTS: There were 522 participants: 291 from COVID-19 units and 231 from comparison units. Only one participant (0.2%, 95%CI: 0.005-1.1%)-an asymptomatic nurse on a COVID-19 unit-tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. In participating COVID-19 units there were two symptomatic HCWs with confirmed COVID-19 in the 2 weeks before the survey; both were infected by contact with a co-worker outside of the COVID-19 unit.

Objective: To assess whether a correlation exists between COVID-19 incidence and chilblains incidence. Design, Setting, and Participants: A retrospective cohort study was conducted within the Kaiser Permanente Northern California system from January 1, 2016, to December 31, 2020; health plan members of all ages were included. Exposure: COVID-19 incidence in 207 location-months, representing 23 geographic locations in northern California across 9 months. Main Outcome and Measures: Chilblains incidence was the main outcome. The association of chilblains incidence with COVID-19 incidence across the 207 location-months was measured using the Spearman rank correlation coefficient. Results: Of 780 patients with chilblains reported during the pandemic, 464 were female (59.5%); mean (SD) age was 36.8 (21.8) years. COVID-19 incidence was correlated with chilblains incidence at 207 location-months (Spearman coefficient 0.18; P = .01). However, only 17 of 456 (3.7%) patients with chilblains tested during the pandemic were positive for SARS-CoV-2, and only 9 of 456 (2.0%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2 within 6 weeks of the chilblains diagnosis. Test results of 1 of 97 (1.0%) patients were positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies. Latinx patients were disproportionately affected by COVID-19 but not by chilblains. Conclusions and Relevance: This cohort study found that in northern California, the incidence of chilblains increased during the pandemic but was correlated weakly with the incidence of COVID-19 across 207 location-months. These findings may have resulted from a causal role of COVID-19, increased care-seeking by patients with chilblains during the pandemic, or changes in behavior during shelter in place.",2021,"McCleskey, Patrick E; Zimmerman, Bree; Lieberman, Amara; Liu, Liyan; Chen, Cynthia; Gorouhi, Farzam; Jacobson, Christine C; Lee, David S; Sriram, Achyuth; Thornton, Amanda; Herz, Arnd M; Mirmirani, Paradi; Herrinton, Lisa J",JAMA Dermatol,,#covidwho-1279331,,,,,235609872

ra009x02,,WHO,Neural Network aided quarantine control model estimation of global Covid-19 spread,,,,unk,"Since the first recording of what we now call Covid-19 infection in Wuhan, Hubei province, China on Dec 31, 2019, the disease has spread worldwide and met with a wide variety of social distancing and quarantine policies. The effectiveness of these responses is notoriously difficult to quantify as individuals travel, violate policies deliberately or inadvertently, and infect others without themselves being detected. In this paper, we attempt to interpret and extrapolate from publicly available data using a mixed first-principles epidemiological equations and data-driven neural network model. Leveraging our neural network augmented model, we focus our analysis on four locales: Wuhan, Italy, South Korea and the United States of America, and compare the role played by the quarantine and isolation measures in each of these countries in controlling the effective reproduction number $R_{t}$ of the virus. Our results unequivocally indicate that the countries in which rapid government interventions and strict public health measures for quarantine and isolation were implemented were successful in halting the spread of infection and prevent it from exploding exponentially. We test the predictive ability of our model by matching predictions in the duration 3 March - 1 April 2020 for Wuhan and in the duration 25 March - 1 April 2020 for Italy and South Korea. In the case of the US, our model captures well the current infected curve growth and predicts a halting of infection spread by 20 April 2020. We further demonstrate that relaxing or reversing quarantine measures right now will lead to an exponential explosion in the infected case count, thus nullifying the role played by all measures implemented in the US since mid March 2020.",2020,"Dandekar, Raj Barbastathis George",,,#ppcovidwho-309064,,,,,214802300

It requires us to represent the system in form of a structural causal model, complete with a causal diagram, probabilistic assumptions on exogenous variables, and functional assignments. Specifying such models can be extremely difficult in practice. The process requires substantial domain expertise, and does not scale easily to large systems, multiple systems, or novel system modifications. At the same time, many application domains, such as molecular biology, are rich in structured causal knowledge that is qualitative in nature. This manuscript proposes a general approach for querying a causal biological knowledge graph, and converting the qualitative result into a quantitative structural causal model that can learn from data to answer the question. We demonstrate the feasibility, accuracy and versatility of this approach using two case studies in systems biology. The first demonstrates the appropriateness of the underlying assumptions and the accuracy of the results.

This study aimed to estimate the effects of five restart strategies after the disruption on required screening capacity and cancer burden. METHODS: Microsimulation models simulated five restart strategies for breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer screening. The models estimated required screening capacity, cancer incidence, and cancer-specific mortality after a disruption of 6 months. The restart strategies varied in whether screens were caught up or not and, if so, immediately or delayed, and whether the upper age limit was increased. RESULTS: The disruption in screening programmes without catch-up of missed screens led to an increase of 2.0, 0.3, and 2.5 cancer deaths per 100 000 individuals in 10 years in breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer, respectively. Immediately catching-up missed screens minimised the impact of the disruption but required a surge in screening capacity. Delaying screening, but still offering all screening rounds gave the best balance between required capacity, incidence, and mortality.

MAIN ARGUMENT Chinese leaders have promoted 5G ICT as a component of both the Belt and Road Initiative and Military-Civil Fusion-efforts intended to extend China's influence around the world for national, commercial, and military advantage. Under Chinese law, 5G ICT firms like Huawei and ZTE are required to grant Chinese authorities access to any data that touches their systems. In response, the U.S. and Japan should consider working to counter the advantages of Chinese firms by cutting off their access to key markets, technology inputs, talent, and capital (""tripping the competition"");build up free-world alternatives (""running faster"");and restructure the global playing field to protect privacy, economic competition, and national security (""putting the fix in""). POLICY IMPLICATIONS * To reduce Chinese firms' market access, the U.S. and Japan have focused on expelling untrustworthy Chinese 5G technology from their ICT markets, tightening foreign investment review processes, enhancing visa screening and working with universities to counter Chinese intellectual property theft and talent recruitment, and ensuring that Chinese 5G firms are unable to draw on allied capital markets to fund their expansion. * To provide alternatives to Chinese 5G ICT, Washington and Tokyo are actively investing in secure and resilient 5G technologies and using these as a bridge to 6G solutions, while leveraging export promotion and development finance tools to help these technologies spread in third-country markets. * To balance privacy, economic competition, and national security, the U.S. and Japan can promote Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) and virtualized core technology solutions to restructure wireless markets, while also working with partners to advocate for data privacy norms embodied in international standard-setting institutions.",2021,"Harold, Scott W.; Kamijima-Tsunoda, Rika",Asia Policy,,#covidwho-1335687,,,,,238677305

The research assay identified 25 additional seropositive individuals (78 [12%] vs. 53 [8%], p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Prior to universal masking, HCP COVID-19 risk was dominated by workplace and community exposures while working in a dedicated COVID-19 unit was protective, suggesting that infection prevention protocols prevent patient-to-HCP transmission.

Because it is unrealistic to manually monitor the number of riders on all buses in operation, a system that can automatically monitor congestion is necessary. The main goal of this paper’s work is to automatically estimate the congestion level on a bus route with acceptable performance. For practical operation, it is necessary to design a system that does not infringe on the privacy of passengers and ensures the safety of passengers and the installation sites. In this paper, we propose a congestion estimation system that protects passengers’ privacy and reduces the installation cost by using Bluetooth low-energy (BLE) signals as sensing data. The proposed system consists of (1) a sensing mechanism that acquires BLE signals emitted from passengers’ mobile terminals in the bus and (2) a mechanism that estimates the degree of congestion in the bus from the data obtained by the sensing mechanism. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed system, we conducted a data collection experiment on an actual bus route in cooperation with Nara Kotsu Co., Ltd. The results showed that the proposed system could estimate the number of passengers with a mean absolute error of 2.49 passengers (error rate of 38.8%).",2022-01-24,"Kanamitsu, Yuji; Taya, Eigo; Tachibana, Koki; Nakamura, Yugo; Matsuda, Yuki; Suwa, Hirohiko; Yasumoto, Keiichi",Sensors (Basel),,,,document_parses/pdf_json/185c4f049e976cf92f2722a2822099482ac52937.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8838786.xml.json,https://doi.org/10.3390/s22030881; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35161627/,246312832

Impact of Baricitinib on Outcomes in Patients Treated with Remdesivir and Dexamethasone for SARS-CoV-2 Pneumonia: A Retrospective Cohort Study,10.1093/ofid/ofab466.706,PMC8644669,,cc-by,"BACKGROUND: There is a lack of data specifically addressing the effects of triple therapy consisting of baricitinib plus remdesivir plus dexamethasone compared to dual therapy with remdesivir plus dexamethasone among patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pneumonia. METHODS: This retrospective study enrolled hospitalized adults with SARS-CoV-2 receiving supplemental oxygen without invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) being treated baricitinib (≤10 days) plus remdesivir (≤10 days) plus dexamethasone (≤10 days) or remdesivir (≤10 days) plus dexamethasone (≤10 days). The primary endpoint was 28-day mortality. Secondary objectives of this study were to measure progression to IMV, pulse oximetry (SpO2)/fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) from hospitalization to discharge, hospital length of stay (LOS), 14-day mortality, 14-day hospital readmissions, inflammatory markers, and safety outcomes. RESULTS: Among patients receiving supplemental oxygen without IMV, 28-day mortality for triple therapy vs. dual therapy was 20% and 24%, respectively (P=1.000). The effect of triple therapy compared to dual therapy on lung function was demonstrated by a 76% vs. 25% increase in SpO2/FiO2. This benefit must be contextualized by an increased progression to IMV among patients receiving triple therapy compared to dual therapy (10 patients [50%] vs. 7 patients [28%], respectively; P=0.130). The increased incidence of IMV translated to a significantly longer hospital LOS among patients receiving triple therapy compared to dual therapy (26 days vs. 17 days, respectively; P=0.001). CONCLUSION: In patients receiving supplemental oxygen without IMV for SARS-CoV-2, triple therapy was not associated with a clinically meaningful reduction in 28-day mortality when compared to dual therapy.

It has become clear that viral genomic RNAs are not simply carriers of hereditary information, but rather are active players in many critical stages during replication. Indeed, functions such as cap-independent translation initiation mechanisms are, in some cases, primarily driven by RNA structural determinants. Other stages including reverse transcription initiation in retroviruses, nuclear export and viral packaging are specifically dependent on the proper 3-dimensional folding of multiple RNA domains to recruit necessary viral and host factors required for activity. Furthermore, a large-scale conformational change within the 5′-untranslated region of HIV-1 has been proposed to regulate the temporal switch between viral protein synthesis and packaging. These RNA-dependent functions are necessary for replication of many human disease-causing viruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-associated coronavirus, West Nile virus, and HIV-1. The potential for antiviral development is currently hindered by a poor understanding of RNA-driven molecular mechanisms, resulting from a lack of structural information on large RNAs and ribonucleoprotein complexes. Herein, we describe the recent progress that has been made on characterizing these large RNAs and provide brief descriptions of the techniques that will be at the forefront of future advances.

Our objective was to determine whether the level of exercise capacity after discharge would affect long-term functional outcomes in these patients. METHODS: From three to five weeks after discharge from acute care hospitals (T(0)), patients underwent a six-minute walk test (6MWT) and were divided into two groups according to the distance walked in percentage of predicted values: <75% group and ≥75% group. At T(0) and three months later (T(1)), patients completed the Short Physical Performance Battery and the Euro Quality of Life Visual Analogue Scale, and pulmonary function and respiratory muscle function were assessed. In addition, a repeat 6MWT was also performed at T(1). RESULTS: At T(0), 6MWD values and Short Physical Performance Battery scores were lower in the <75% group than in the ≥75% group. No differences were found in the Euro Quality of Life Visual Analogue Scale scores, pulmonary function variables, respiratory muscle function variables, length of hospital stay, or previous treatment. At T(1), both groups improved their exercise capacity, but only the subjects in the <75% group showed significant improvements in dyspnea and lower extremity function. Exercise capacity and functional status values returned to predicted values in all of the patients in both groups.

The only successful approach to achieve it in patients has been a combined kidney and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation from an HLA-matched or -mismatched living donor. Here, we report the first three patients in Europe included in a clinical trial aiming at the induction of tolerance by mixed lymphohematopoietic chimerism after kidney transplantation. Two female and one male patient were transplanted with a kidney and peripherally mobilized hematopoietic stem cells from their HLA-identical sibling donor. The protocol followed previous studies at Stanford University: kidney transplantation was performed on day 0 including induction with anti-thymocyte globulin followed by conditioning with 10x 1.2 Gy total lymphoid irradiation and the transfusion of CD34+ cells together with a body weight-adjusted dose of donor T cells on day 11. Immunosuppression consisted of cyclosporine A and steroids for 10 days, cyclosporine A and mycophenolate mofetil for 1 month, and then cyclosporine A monotherapy with tapering over 9–20 months. The 3 patients have been off immunosuppression for 4 years, 19 months and 8 months, respectively. No rejection or graft-versus-host disease occurred. Hematological donor chimerism was stable in the first, but slowly declining in the other two patients. A molecular microscope analysis in patient 2 revealed the genetic profile of a normal kidney. No relevant infections were observed, and the quality of life in all three patients is excellent. During the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, all three patients were vaccinated with the mRNA vaccine BNT162b2 (Comirnaty(®)), and they showed excellent humoral and in 2 out 3 patients also cellular SARS-CoV-2-specific immunity. Thus, combined kidney and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is a feasible and successful approach to induce specific immunological tolerance in the setting of HLA-matched sibling living kidney donation while maintaining immune responsiveness to an mRNA vaccine (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT00365846).",2022-01-31,"Fehr, Thomas; Hübel, Kerstin; de Rougemont, Olivier; Abela, Irene; Gaspert, Ariana; Güngör, Tayfun; Hauri, Mathias; Helmchen, Birgit; Linsenmeier, Claudia; Müller, Thomas; Nilsson, Jakob; Riesterer, Oliver; Scandling, John D.; Schanz, Urs; Cippà, Pietro E.",Front Immunol,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/af0d9851a09280376a9a136b49dd148719166d7e.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8841472.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35173720/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2022.796456,246412559

Parameters, such as time, pH and concentrations of β-CD and gold, were optimized for the synthesis of β-CD-AuNP. The addition of enantiomers and racemic mixture of hydroxychloroquine (R-HCQ, S-HCQ and RS-HCQ) drugs and their interaction with β-CD led to a red shift in the surface plasmon resonance of β-CD-AuNP. The changes associated with the introduction of HCQ in β-CD-AuNP were studied using various characterization techniques such as UV-vis, FT-IR, XRD, dynamic light scattering, zeta potential, transmission electron microscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy and electrochemical techniques. The host-guest interaction of β-cyclodextrin with S-HCQ, R-HCQ and RS-HCQ resulted in the aggregation of gold nanoparticles. The surface plasmon resonance at 521 nm for β-CD-AuNP was shifted to 600, 620 and 670 nm on the addition of S-HCQ, R-HCQ and RS-HCQ, respectively, with a color change from pink to blue. The selectivity and sensitivity of the developed system for RS-HCQ were investigated and the limit of detection (LOD=3 s/m) was found to be 2.61, 0.15, and 0.85 nM for optical, fluorescence and electrochemical methods, respectively.

Even though challenges and opportunities of telemedicine are increasingly becoming well documented for geriatrics (such as improving access to healthcare, patient management, and education while reducing costs), there is still limited knowledge on how to better implement it in an inter-organizational context, especially when considering nursing homes. In this regard, this study aimed first to describe the telemedicine activity of nursing homes when cooperating with a general hospital; and then understand the behavioral differences amongst nursing homes while identifying critical factors when implementing a telemedicine project. We conducted a sequential, explanatory mixed-method study using quantitative then qualitative methods to better understand the results. Three years of teleconsultation data of twenty-six nursing homes (15 rural and 11 urban) conducting teleconsultations with a general hospital (Troyes Hospital, France) were included for the quantitative analysis, and eleven telemedicine project managers for the qualitative analysis. Between April 2018 and April 2021, 590 teleconsultations were conducted: 45% (n = 265) were conducted for general practice, 29% (n = 172) for wound care, 11% (n = 62) for diabetes management, 8% (n = 47) with gerontologist and 6% (n = 38) for dermatology. Rural nursing homes conducted more teleconsultations overall than urban ones (RR: 2.484; 95% CI: 1.083 to 5.518; p = 0.03) and included more teleconsultations for general practice (RR: 16.305; 95% CI: 3.505 to 73.523; p = 0.001). Our qualitative study showed that three critical factors are required for the implementation of a telemedicine project in nursing homes: (1) the motivation to perform teleconsultations (in other words, improving access to care and cooperation between professionals); (2) building a relevant telemedicine medical offer based on patients’ and treating physicians’ needs; and (3) it’s specific organization in terms of time and space. Our study showed different uses of teleconsultations according to the rural or urban localization of nursing homes and that telemedicine projects should be designed to consider this aspect. Triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic, telemedicine projects in nursing homes are increasing, and observing the three critical factors presented above could be necessary to limit the failure of such projects.",2021-10-23,"Cormi, Clément; Chrusciel, Jan; Fayol, Antoine; Van Rechem, Michel; Abou-Amsha, Khuloud; Tixier, Matthieu; Lewkowicz, Myriam; Laplanche, David; Sanchez, Stéphane",Int J Environ Res Public Health,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/5c2fe3bf4d1521953c85bbb1b69e6ebcf7c5cc89.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8583601.xml.json,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph182111148; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34769665/,239915133

METHODS: This was a retrospective cross‐sectional study of patients in an integrated healthcare system in Sweden, covering a population of 465,000, with a diagnostic test for VTE between March 1 and May 31 in the years 2015 to 2020. Risk for VTE with COVID‐19 was assessed by logistic regression, adjusting for baseline risk factors. RESULTS: A total of 8702 patients were included, and 88 of those patients tested positive on the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) polymerase chain reaction test. A positive SARS‐CoV‐2 test did not increase the odds for VTE (odds ratio, 0.97; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.55–1.74) and did not change when adjusting for sex, previous VTE, previous malignancy, Charlson score, hospital admission, intensive care, or ongoing treatment with anticoagulation (odds ratio, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.16–3.3). The prevalence of VTE was unchanged in 2020 compared with 2015 to 2019 (16.5% vs 16.1%, respectively), and there was no difference in VTE between the SARS‐CoV‐2 positive, negative, or untested groups in 2020 (15.9%, 17.6%, and 15.7%, respectively; P = 0.85). CONCLUSIONS: We found no increased prevalence of VTE in the general population compared with previous years and no increased risk of VTE in patients who were SARS‐CoV‐2 positive, suggesting that SARS‐CoV‐2 status should not influence VTE workup in the emergency department. The prevalence of VTE was high in patients with SARS‐CoV‐2 treated in the intensive care unit (ICU), where the suspicion for VTE should remain high.",2021-09-01,"Wretborn, Jens; Jörg, Matthias; Benjaminsson Nyberg, Patrik; Wilhelms, Daniel B.",J Am Coll Emerg Physicians Open,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/cb5490addfb95fa20dc60c05408c5f7b90310e12.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8410024.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34485977/; https://doi.org/10.1002/emp2.12530,237409342

Chemical modifications like nucleoside methylation endow the synthetic mRNAs with high stability and reduced stimulation of innate immunity. The development of scalable production of synthetic mRNA and efficient mRNA formulation and delivery strategies in recent years have remarkably advanced the field. It is worth noticing that we had limited knowledge on the roles of mRNA modifications in the past. However, the last decade has witnessed not only new discoveries of several naturally occurring mRNA modifications but also substantial advances in understanding their roles on regulating gene expression.

In a traditional poultry house, breeders must usually observe the health of the broilers in person on the basis of their breeding experience at regular times every day. When a breeder finds unhealthy broilers, they are removed manually from the poultry house to prevent viruses from spreading in the poultry house. Therefore, in this study, we designed and constructed a novel small removal system for dead chickens for Taiwanese poultry houses. In the mechanical design, this system mainly contains walking, removal, and storage parts. It comprises robotic arms with a fixed end and sweep-in devices for sweeping dead chickens, a conveyor belt for transporting chickens, a storage cache for storing chickens, and a tracked vehicle. The designed system has dimensions of approximately 1.038 × 0.36 × 0.5 m(3), and two dead chickens can be removed in a single operation. The walking speed of the chicken removal system is 3.3 cm/s. In order to enhance the automation and artificial intelligence in the poultry industry, the identification system was used in a novel small removal system. The conditions of the chickens in a poultry house can be monitored remotely by using a camera, and dead chickens can be identified through deep learning based on the YOLO v4 algorithm. The precision of the designed system reached 95.24% in this study, and dead chickens were successfully moved to the storage cache.

Some reports indicate that liver injury may be a poor prognostic factor. AIM: To identify the biochemical factors related to the development of SARS with mechanical ventilation (MV) requirement in patients with SARSCov-2 and COVID-19. Methods. Type of Study: Observational. Cohort study. Procedure: Data from COVID-19 patients were collected at admission time to a tertiary care center. Differential factors were identified between seriously ill SARS + MV patients versus stable patients without MV. Transformation to the natural logarithm of significant variables was performed and multiple linear regression was applied, then a predictive model of severity called AAD (Age-AST-D dimer) was constructed. Result(s): 166 patients were included, 114(68.7%) men, mean age 50.6 +/- 13.3 years-old, 27(16.3%) developed SARS + MV. In the comparative analysis between those with SARS + MV versus stable patients without MV we found significant raises of ALT (225.4 +/- 341.2 vs. 41.3 +/- 41.1;P = 0.003), AST 325.3 +/- 382.4 vs. 52.8 +/- 47.1;P = 0.001), LDH (764.6 +/- 401.9 vs. 461.0 +/- 185.6;P = 0.001), D dimer (7765 +/- 9109 vs. 1871 +/- 4146;P = 0.003), age (58.6 +/- 12.7 vs. 49.1 +/- 12.8;P = 0-001). The results of the regression are shown in the Table, where model 3 was the one that best explained the development of SARS + MV;with these variables was constructed the model called AAD, where: [AAD = 3.896 + ln(age)x-0.218 + ln(AST)x-0.185 + ln(DD)x0.070], where a value = 2.75 had sensitivity = 0.797 and 1-specificity = 0.391, AUROC = 0.74 (95%CI: 0.62-0.86;P 0.0001), to predict the risk of developing SARS + MV (OR = 5.8, 95%CI: 2.2-15.4;P = 0.001). Conclusion(s): Elevation of AST (probable marker of liver damage) is an important predictor of progression to SARS, together with elevation of D-dimer and age early (at admission) and efficiently predict which patients will potentially require MV.

This paper aims to estimate the adjusted incremental health care expenditures of having a spouse with ADRD. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study of publicly available survey data (2003-2017 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey). SETTING: Representative sample of U.S. households. PARTICIPANTS: Community-dwelling and married older adults (n=28,356). MEASUREMENT: Two-part models and recycled prediction techniques to estimate the incremental effects of having a spouse with ADRD on annual health care expenditures, while adjusting for demographics, socioeconomic characteristics, and health conditions. RESULTS: Spouses of older adults with ADRD were older, had worse perceived mental health, and had greater difficulties with activities of daily living, compared to older adults with cognitively normal spouses. Spouses of ADRD patients had significantly higher unadjusted total health care expenditures, however their adjusted incremental expenditure was not significantly greater. After controlling for demographics and health status, ADRD spouses had significantly higher home health care expenditures, but significantly lower outpatient expenditures. CONCLUSION: Results suggested that the higher health care expenditures in older adults with ADRD spouses can be attributed to the higher rate of comorbidities, rate of functional limitations, and mean age in this group. The increased use of home health and decreased use of outpatient in this population suggests the importance of tailoring preventative health care and social services to meet the needs of this group.",2020-09-30,"Chu, Jun; Benjenk, Ivy; Chen, Jie",Am J Geriatr Psychiatry,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/06c82af2fecc97710e8c8c81b065875293a49698.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7525656.xml.json,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1064748120305029; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33071189/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1064748120305029?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jagp.2020.09.020,222001148

To this date, no specific drugs or vaccines are available to treat SARS-CoV-2 despite its close relation to the SARS-CoV virus that caused a similar epidemic in 2003. Thus, there remains an urgent need for the identification and development of specific antiviral therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2. To conquer viral infections, the inhibition of proteases essential for proteolytic processing of viral polyproteins is a conventional therapeutic strategy. In order to find novel inhibitors, we computationally screened a compound library of over 606 million compounds for binding at the recently solved crystal structure of the main protease (M(pro)) of SARS-CoV-2. A screening of such a vast chemical space for SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) inhibitors has not been reported before. After shape screening, two docking protocols were applied followed by the determination of molecular descriptors relevant for pharmacokinetics to narrow down the number of initial hits. Next, molecular dynamics simulations were conducted to validate the stability of docked binding modes and comprehensively quantify ligand binding energies. After evaluation of potential off-target binding, we report a list of 12 purchasable compounds, with binding affinity to the target protease that is predicted to be more favorable than that of the cocrystallized peptidomimetic compound. In order to quickly advise ongoing therapeutic intervention for patients, we evaluated approved antiviral drugs and other protease inhibitors to provide a list of nine compounds for drug repurposing.

Testicular torsion is an emergent condition with higher risk of testicular loss with longer ischemic times. We sought to investigate whether patients with testicular torsion had longer time from symptom onset to initial presentation, longer total ischemic time, and higher rate of orchiectomy during the pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using billing data, we identified all patients age >1yo seen in our hospital from 1/1/2018 through 5/31/2020 who underwent emergent scrotal exploration for confirmed testicular torsion, comparing the COVID-19 crisis (3/1/2020-5/31/20) to the pre-COVID-19 period (1/1/2018-2/29/20). The primary outcome was time from symptom onset to initial presentation and secondary outcomes were ischemic time (time from symptom onset to entry of the OR) and orchiectomy rate. Parameters were compared with Mann-Whitney U and Fisher’s exact tests; Poisson regression compared rates of torsion. RESULTS: Of 94 total cases, 77 occurred during the pre-COVID-19 period and 17 during the COVID-19 crisis. Median time from symptom onset to initial presentation was not significantly different (2.4 hr [IQR 1.1 hr – 38.9] during COVID-19 vs. 5.6 hrs [IQR 1.6 – 16.9] during pre-COVID-19 period, p=0.476). Time to presentation was >12 hrs in 5/17 patients (29%) during COVID-19 and 24/77 patients (31%) during pre-COVID-19 period (p=1.00). Median ischemic time during COVID-19 was 7.5 hr (IQR 4.7 hr – 45.5 hr) compared to 9.4 hr (IQR 5.4 hr – 22.5 hr) during pre-COVID-19 period (p=0.694). Incidence of orchiectomy in our center was 29% (5/17) during COVID-19 and 17% (13/77) during pre-COVID-19 period (p=0.397). About half of patients were seen initially at outside facilities prior to arrival (47% [8/17] during COVID-19 vs. 49% [38/77] during pre-COVID-19 period, p=1.00). The number of torsion case presentations per week to our facility increased from 0.7 cases/week in the pre-COVID-19 period to 1.3 cases/week during COVID-19 (p=0.015); when comparing only the March 1 to May 31 calendar period, there were 0.6 cases/week during the pre-COVID-19 period and 1.3 cases/week during COVID-19 (p=0.021). CONCLUSION: Time to presentation, ischemic times, and orchiectomy rates for testicular torsion at our center were not significantly different during the COVID-19 period compared to the preceding 2 year period.

In this study, we report the emergence, mixed infection, and genetic characterization of 15 novel field PEDV variants with large genomic deletions. The sizes of deletion varied between 582 nt (194 aa) and 648 nt (216 aa) at positions 28–714 (10–238) on the S gene (protein). Among 17 PEDV samples isolated from individual pigs, all of them contained at least two distinct genotypes with large genomic deletions, and 94.1% of them were found to consist of strains with an intact S gene. These variants were found in eight primary and nine recurrent outbreaks, and they might be associated with persistent PEDV infection in the farms. Full-length S and ORF3 genes of eight variants derived from 2 samples were characterized. This is the first report of mixed infections caused by various genotypes of PEDV and would be important for the studies of viral isolation, pathogenesis, and molecular epidemiology of the disease.",2017-01-17,"Diep, Nguyen Van; Norimine, Junzo; Sueyoshi, Masuo; Lan, Nguyen Thi; Yamaguchi, Ryoji",PLoS One,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/32c5106b9647b0d72f6c6fb15bf114e15d71736d.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5241010.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28095455/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0170126,17891447
